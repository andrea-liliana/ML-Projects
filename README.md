# Machine lLarning projects

The first project consists on the baics of machine learning and concepts such as under- and over-fitting, decision trees, K-nearest neighbors and Residual fitting. Using Scikit-Learn. 

The second project includes the analytical derivations of the Bayes model and the residual error in classification, as well as the derivations of bias and variance of the ridge regression.
